\section{Planning} \label{planning}
For the purpose of tracking the progress and to avoid violating the deadline, a rough planning is created. Table 1 reflects the work expected to be done during this project with a date indication. Due to the relatively short length of the project, no further task distribution has been defined. All activities will be performed as a group.
