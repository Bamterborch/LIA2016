\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Maintaining a consistent configuration across a large series of frequently changing systems can be a daunting task withoout the use of any configuration management tools. These tools  allow companies to automate deployments in a consistent manner and identify changes in hardware and software configuration or general infrastructure in a centralized manner. Most commonly, established tools such as Puppet\cite{whatispuppet}, Chef \cite{whatischef} and Ansible\cite{whatisansible} are used for this purpose. However, problems occur when two companies using different mechanisms to manage their systems need to merge. In the end, only one solution has to be selected, which requires a migration trajectory of some sort. An all or nothing approach is hard to perform as it has all the disadvantages which apply to any big bang migration. Therefore, we are interested in what needs to be done to make a gradual migration possible. We are mainly interested in whether it is possible to send commands with one configuration management tool to another, and as such transfer the management role between management systems in a gradual fashion. During the course of this project we will select two of the most popular systems and perform a transition in a small scale lab environment.
