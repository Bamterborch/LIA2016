In order to perform this project a small lab environment will be created. The hardware for this project is primarily being facilitated by the University of Amsterdam. For this project to work, four virtual servers will be created. Two of the servers will be utilized to run a Puppet and Ansible server respectively. The remaining machines are required to test new management system settings on. Additionally, as we are inexperienced in either configuration management system, we require some quick lessons in Ansible and Puppet. This will mainly be done by via literature study. However, as we are pressed for time we will also attend a in-house presentation on configuration management provided by employees of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.
