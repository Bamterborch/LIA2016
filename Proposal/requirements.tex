\chapter{requirements}\label{requirements}
For this project to work, four virtual servers are necessary. one needs to run a Puppet server, one needs to run a Ansible server and the other two are needed to test new management system settings on.
Next to that we need to make this project work. Not much could be expected when we don't get the proper amount of time to research a topic. 
We also need some quick lessons in Ansible and Puppet.
