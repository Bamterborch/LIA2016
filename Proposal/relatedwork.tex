The security and forensics of Chromecast devices and Miracast devices in particular has been researched in the past multiple times \cite{tekeoglu2014blackbox} \cite{tekeoglu2015closer} \cite{forensics2014chromecast}. However, these papers mainly focus on the overall security of the device and do not take into account the recently introduced 'Guest mode' functionality. As previously discussed, this mode makes use of ultrasound in order to pair an end user device with the Chromecast. Little official research has been done on the security of this method of pairing. Unofficial research however has shown that it is possible to intercept these signals with commodity hardware \cite{chris'anfractuosus'2014} \cite{borissmus2013}. The research to be conducted will build upon the knowledge gained from these previous articles and papers.
