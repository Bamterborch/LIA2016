\section{Research question}\label{sec:researchquestion}
As previously mentioned in Section \ref{sec:introduction}, this research project aims to investigate a migration trajectory between two established configuration management tools as a result of a corporate fusion. Because a corporate environment generally requires a stable migration, the focus of this project is to answer the following question:
\\\\
\textit{How to make an operating system automatically migrate between configuration management systems?}
\\\\
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:relatedwork}, another interesting aspect may be to look at the architectural differences between established configuration management tools like Puppet, Ansible and next generation configuration management prototypes like \texttt{mgmt}. Due to the limited amount of available time, this will be limited to a theoretical analysis. Section \ref{sec:method} will explain what steps need to be taken to properly answer this research question.
