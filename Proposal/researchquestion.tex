\chapter{Research question}\label{ch:researchquestion}
As previously mentioned in Section \ref{intro}, this research project aims to investigate a migration trajectory between two established configuration management tools as a result of a corporate fusion. Therefore, the focus of this project is to answer the following question:

\textit{[RESEARCH QUESTION]}
How to make a system automatically migrate between management systems?

As mentioned in Section \ref{background}, another interesting aspect may be to look at the conceptual differences between established configuration management tools like Puppet, Ansible and next generation configuration management prototypes like \texttt{mgmt}. Due to the limited amount of available time, this will be limited to a theoretical analysis. 
To answer this question in a proper way, chapter \ref{ch:method} will explain what steps need to be taken for a system to switch management system.
