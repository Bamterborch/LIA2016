In order for Puppet to accept all machine certificates an \texttt{autosign.conf} file has to be created in the standard configuration directory \texttt{$confdir}. The contents of this file function as a whitelist and is very restrictive by default. To accept all certificates, the only contents of this file should be a single wildcard '*'. This means that machines from all possible domains are accepted automatically. Naturally this poses security risks and would require sufficient seggregation in a production environment.
