Therefore, the aim of this research project is to answer the following main research question:

\begin{quote}
\textit{How can an operating system be automatically migrated between two configuration management systems?}
\end{quote}

\noindent
The scope of this research is limited by exclusively examining the configuration management tools Puppet and Ansible. Puppet currently proves to have the most commercial backing and is most likely to be deployed in production environments [SOURCE]. Ansible is a more recent tool and it is gaining traction in corporate environments at a rapid rate. It is being developed by an active community and is backed by Red Hat. Additionally, since current configuration management systems are effectively limited in scalability due to their architectural model, we discuss the distributed architecture of a \texttt{mgmt}, which at this point in time is a prototype configuration management system.
