Deploying Docker containers is currently primarily done via Docker files which contain pre-defined commands in order to deploy a service with a given configuration. Problems occur when the services to be deployed become overly complex as they require relatively static and unmanageable Docker files. Configuration management tools like the ones discusses are currently trying to fix this issue by supporting fine-grained configuration management features for various types of container platforms. However, as such features become available the line between 'true' orchestration tools like Kubernetes become less obvious. It would be interesting to see how orchestration tools at this point in time relate to configuration management tools.
